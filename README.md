## ðŸŽ® Description

This project is a modified version of the classic **SkiFree**, implemented in C++ using **Nothofagus** for graphics and **RustyAudio** for audio. The goal is to avoid obstacles and survive as long as possible, with the snow monster appearing randomly. In this modified version, instead of a snowboard, the player controls a **skateboard**.
### Features
- **Player control** via arrow keys.
- **Obstacles** that modify speed (accelerate or slow down).
- **UI** using ImGui to show game data (time, distance, speed).
- **Sounds** for important events (collisions, accelerations, etc).
- **Snow monster** appears randomly between 2-4 minutes.
